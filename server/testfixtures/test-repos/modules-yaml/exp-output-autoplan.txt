Ran Plan for 2 projects:
1. workspace: `default` dir: `staging`
1. workspace: `default` dir: `production`

### 1. workspace: `default` dir: `staging`
```diff
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

+ module.null.null_resource.this
      id: <computed>
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

```
