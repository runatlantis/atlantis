Ran Plan for 2 projects:

1. dir: `infrastructure/staging` workspace: `default`
1. dir: `infrastructure/production` workspace: `default`

### 1. dir: `infrastructure/staging` workspace: `default`
```diff
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
+ create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.staging[0] will be created
+ resource "null_resource" "staging" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```
