Ran Plan for 2 projects:

1. dir: `dir1` workspace: `default`
1. dir: `dir2` workspace: `default`

### 1. dir: `dir1` workspace: `default`
```diff
random_id.dummy1: Refreshing state... [id=AA]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration
and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # random_id.dummy2 will be created
+ resource "random_id" "dummy2" {
      + b64_std     = (known after apply)
      + b64_url     = (known after apply)
      + byte_length = 1
      + dec         = (known after apply)
      + hex         = (known after apply)
      + id          = (known after apply)
