### 1. dir: `staging` workspace: `default`

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
+ create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.null.null_resource.this will be created
+ resource "null_resource" "this" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
