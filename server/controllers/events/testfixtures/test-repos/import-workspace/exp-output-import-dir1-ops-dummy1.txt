Ran Import for project: `dir1-ops` dir: `dir1` workspace: `ops`

```diff
random_id.dummy1[0]: Importing from ID "AA"...
random_id.dummy1[0]: Import prepared!
  Prepared random_id for import
random_id.dummy1[0]: Refreshing state... [id=AA]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
