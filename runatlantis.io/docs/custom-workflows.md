# Custom Workflows

Custom workflows can be defined to override the default commands that Atlantis
runs.

[[toc]]

## Usage
Custom workflows can be specified in the Server-Side Repo Config or in the Repo-Level
`atlantis.yaml` files.

**Notes**
* If you want to allow repos to select their own workflows, they must have the
`allowed_overrides: [workflow]` setting. See [server-side repo config use cases](server-side-repo-config.html#allow-repos-to-choose-a-server-side-workflow) for more details.
* If in addition you also want to allow repos to define their own workflows, they must have the
`allow_custom_workflows: true` setting. See [server-side repo config use cases](server-side-repo-config.html#allow-repos-to-define-their-own-workflows) for more details.


## Use Cases
### .tfvars files
Given the structure:
```
.
└── project1
    ├── main.tf
    ├── production.tfvars
    └── staging.tfvars
```

If you wanted Atlantis to automatically run plan with `-var-file staging.tfvars` and `-var-file production.tfvars`
you could define two workflows:
```yaml
# repos.yaml or atlantis.yaml
workflows:
  staging:
    plan:
      steps:
      - init
      - plan:
          extra_args: ["-var-file", "staging.tfvars"]
    # NOTE: no need to define the apply stage because it will default
    # to the normal apply stage.
    
  production:
    plan:
      steps:
      - init
      - plan:
          extra_args: ["-var-file", "production.tfvars"]
```
Then in your repo-level `atlantis.yaml` file, you would reference the workflows:
```yaml
# atlantis.yaml
version: 3
projects:
# If two or more projects have the same dir and workspace, they must also have
# a 'name' key to differentiate them.
- name: project1-staging
  dir: project1
  workflow: staging
- name: project1-production
  dir: project1
  workflow: production

workflows:
  # If you didn't define the workflows in your server-side repos.yaml config,
  # you would define them here instead.
```
When you want to apply the plans, you can comment
```
atlantis apply -p project1-staging
```
and
```
atlantis apply -p project1-production
```
Where `-p` refers to the project name.

### Adding extra arguments to Terraform commands
If you need to append flags to `terraform plan` or `apply` temporarily, you can
append flags on a comment following `--`, for example commenting:
```
atlantis plan -- -lock=false
```

If you always need to do this for a project's `init`, `plan` or `apply` commands
then you must define a custom workflow and set the `extra_args` key for the
command you need to modify.

```yaml
# atlantis.yaml or repos.yaml
workflows:
  myworkflow:
    plan:
      steps:
      - init:
          extra_args: ["-lock=false"]
      - plan:
          extra_args: ["-lock=false"]
    apply:
      steps:
      - apply:
          extra_args: ["-lock=false"]
```

If [policy checking](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/policy-checking.html#how-it-works) is enabled, `extra_args` can also be used to change the default behaviour of conftest.

```yaml
workflows:
  myworkflow:
    policy_check:
      steps:
      - show
      - policy_check:
          extra_args: ["--all-namespaces"]
```

### Custom init/plan/apply Commands
If you want to customize `terraform init`, `plan` or `apply` in ways that
aren't supported by `extra_args`, you can completely override those commands.

In this example, we're not using any of the built-in commands and are instead
using our own.

```yaml
# atlantis.yaml or repos.yaml
workflows:
  myworkflow:
    plan:
      steps:
      - run: terraform init -input=false -no-color
      
      # If you're using workspaces you need to select the workspace using the
      # $WORKSPACE environment variable.
      - run: terraform workspace select -no-color $WORKSPACE
      
      # You MUST output the plan using -out $PLANFILE because Atlantis expects
      # plans to be in a specific location.
      - run: terraform plan -input=false -refresh -no-color -out $PLANFILE
    apply:
      steps:
      # Again, you must use the $PLANFILE environment variable.
      - run: terraform apply -no-color $PLANFILE
```

### Terragrunt
Atlantis supports running custom commands in place of the default Atlantis
commands. We can use this functionality to enable
[Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt).

You can either use your repo's `atlantis.yaml` file or the Atlantis server's `repos.yaml` file.

Given a directory structure:
```
.
└── live
    ├── prod
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    └── staging
        └── terragrunt.hcl
```

If using the server `repos.yaml` file, you would use the following config:

```yaml
# repos.yaml
# Specify TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH environment variable to accomodate setting --default-tf-version
# Generate json plan via terragrunt for policy checks
repos:
- id: "/.*/"
  workflow: terragrunt
workflows:
  terragrunt:
    plan:
      steps:
      - env:
          name: TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH
          command: 'echo "terraform${ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION}"'
      - run: terragrunt plan -no-color -out=$PLANFILE
      - run: terragrunt show -no-color -json $PLANFILE > $SHOWFILE
    apply:
      steps:
      - env:
          name: TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH
          command: 'echo "terraform${ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION}"'
      - run: terragrunt apply -no-color $PLANFILE
```

If using the repo's `atlantis.yaml` file you would use the following config:
```yaml
version: 3
projects:
- dir: live/staging
  workflow: terragrunt
- dir: live/prod
  workflow: terragrunt
workflows:
  terragrunt:
    plan:
      steps:
      - env:
          name: TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH
          command: 'echo "terraform${ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION}"'
      - run: terragrunt plan -no-color -out $PLANFILE
    apply:
      steps:
      - env:
          name: TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH
          command: 'echo "terraform${ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION}"'
      - run: terragrunt apply -no-color $PLANFILE
```

**NOTE:** If using the repo's `atlantis.yaml` file, you will need to specify each directory that is a Terragrunt project.


::: warning
Atlantis will need to have the `terragrunt` binary in its PATH.
If you're using Docker you can build your own image, see [Customization](/docs/deployment.html#customization).
:::

If you don't want to create/manage the repo's `atlantis.yaml` file yourself, you can use the tool [terragrunt-atlantis-config](https://github.com/transcend-io/terragrunt-atlantis-config) to generate it.

The `terragrunt-atlantis-config` tool is a community project and not maintained by the Atlantis team.

### Running custom commands
Atlantis supports running completely custom commands. In this example, we want to run
a script after every `apply`:

```yaml
# repos.yaml or atlantis.yaml
workflows:
  myworkflow:
    apply:
      steps:
      - apply
      - run: ./my-custom-script.sh
```

::: tip Notes
* We don't need to write a `plan` key under `myworkflow`. If `plan`
isn't set, Atlantis will use the default plan workflow which is what we want in this case.
* A custom command will only terminate if all output file descriptors are closed.
Therefore a custom command can only be sent to the background (e.g. for an SSH tunnel during
the terraform run) when its output is redirected to a different location. For example, Atlantis
will execute a custom script containing the following code to create a SSH tunnel correctly: 
`ssh -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_tunnel -L 3306:database:3306 -N bastion 1>/dev/null 2>&1`. Without
the redirect, the script would block the Atlantis workflow.
:::

### Custom Backend Config
If you need to specify the `-backend-config` flag to `terraform init` you'll need to use a custom workflow.
In this example, we're using custom backend files to configure two remote states, one for each environment.
We're then using `.tfvars` files to load different variables for each environment.

```yaml
# repos.yaml or atlantis.yaml
workflows:
  staging:
    plan:
      steps:
      - run: rm -rf .terraform
      - init:
          extra_args: [-backend-config=staging.backend.tfvars]
      - plan:
          extra_args: [-var-file=staging.tfvars]
  production:
    plan:
      steps:
      - run: rm -rf .terraform
      - init:
          extra_args: [-backend-config=production.backend.tfvars]
      - plan:
          extra_args: [-var-file=production.tfvars]
```
::: warning NOTE
We have to use a custom `run` step to `rm -rf .terraform` because otherwise Terraform
will complain in-between commands since the backend config has changed.
:::

You would then reference the workflows in your repo-level `atlantis.yaml`:
```yaml
version: 3
projects:
- name: staging
  dir: .
  workflow: staging
- name: production
  dir: .
  workflow: production
```

- plan
- apply
```
| Key             | Type   | Default | Required | Description                                                                                            |

    extra_args: [arg1, arg2]
- plan:
    extra_args: [arg1, arg2]
- apply:
    extra_args: [arg1, arg2]

```
| Key | Type   | Default | Required | Description          |
|-----|--------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| run | string | none    | no       | Run a custom command |

::: tip Notes
* `run` steps are executed with the following environment variables:
  * `WORKSPACE` - The Terraform workspace used for this project, ex. `default`.
    * NOTE: if the step is executed before `init` then Atlantis won't have switched to this workspace yet.
  * `ATLANTIS_TERRAFORM_VERSION` - The version of Terraform used for this project, ex. `0.11.0`.
  * `DIR` - Absolute path to the current directory.
  * `PLANFILE` - Absolute path to the location where Atlantis expects the plan to
  either be generated (by plan) or already exist (if running apply). Can be used to
  override the built-in `plan`/`apply` commands, ex. `run: terraform plan -out $PLANFILE`.
  * `SHOWFILE` - Absolute path to the location where Atlantis expects the plan in json format to
  either be generated (by show) or already exist (if running policy checks). Can be used to
  override the built-in `plan`/`apply` commands, ex. `run: terraform show -json $PLANFILE > $SHOWFILE`.
  * `BASE_REPO_NAME` - Name of the repository that the pull request will be merged into, ex. `atlantis`.
  * `BASE_REPO_OWNER` - Owner of the repository that the pull request will be merged into, ex. `runatlantis`.
  * `HEAD_REPO_NAME` - Name of the repository that is getting merged into the base repository, ex. `atlantis`.
  * `HEAD_REPO_OWNER` - Owner of the repository that is getting merged into the base repository, ex. `acme-corp`.
  * `HEAD_BRANCH_NAME` - Name of the head branch of the pull request (the branch that is getting merged into the base)
  * `HEAD_COMMIT` - The sha256 that points to the head of the branch that is being pull requested into the base. If the pull request is from Bitbucket Cloud the string will only be 12 characters long because Bitbucket Cloud truncates its commit IDs.
  * `BASE_BRANCH_NAME` - Name of the base branch of the pull request (the branch that the pull request is getting merged into)
  * `PROJECT_NAME` - Name of the project configured in `atlantis.yaml`. If no project name is configured this will be an empty string.
  * `PULL_NUM` - Pull request number or ID, ex. `2`.
  * `PULL_AUTHOR` - Username of the pull request author, ex. `acme-user`.
  * `REPO_REL_DIR` - The relative path of the project in the repository. For example if your project is in `dir1/dir2/` then this will be set to `"dir1/dir2"`. If your project is at the root this will be `"."`.
  * `USER_NAME` - Username of the VCS user running command, ex. `acme-user`. During an autoplan, the user will be the Atlantis API user, ex. `atlantis`.
  * `COMMENT_ARGS` - Any additional flags passed in the comment on the pull request. Flags are separated by commas and
  every character is escaped, ex. `atlantis plan -- arg1 arg2` will result in `COMMENT_ARGS=\a\r\g\1,\a\r\g\2`.
* A custom command will only terminate if all output file descriptors are closed.
Therefore a custom command can only be sent to the background (e.g. for an SSH tunnel during
the terraform run) when its output is redirected to a different location. For example, Atlantis
will execute a custom script containing the following code to create a SSH tunnel correctly: 
`ssh -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_tunnel -L 3306:database:3306 -N bastion 1>/dev/null 2>&1`. Without
the redirect, the script would block the Atlantis workflow.
* If a workflow step returns a non-zero exit code, the workflow will stop.

#### Environment Variable `env` Command
The `env` command allows you to set environment variables that will be available
to all steps defined **below** the `env` step.

You can set hard coded values via the `value` key, or set dynamic values via
the `command` key which allows you to run any command and uses the output
as the environment variable value.
```yaml
- env:
    name: ENV_NAME
    value: hard-coded-value
- env:
    name: ENV_NAME_2
    command: 'echo "dynamic-value-$(date)"'
```
| Key             | Type                               | Default | Required | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| env | map[`name` -> string, `value` -> string, `command` -> string] | none    | no       | Set environment variables for subsequent steps |

::: tip Notes
* `env` `command`'s can use any of the built-in environment variables available
  to `run` commands.
