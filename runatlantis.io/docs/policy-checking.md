# Conftest Policy Checking

Atlantis supports running server-side [conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/) policies against the plan output. Common usecases
for using this step include:

- Denying usage of a list of modules
- Asserting attributes of a resource at creation time
- Catching unintentional resource deletions
- Preventing security risks (ie. exposing secure ports to the public)

## How it works?

Enabling "policy checking" in addition to the [mergeable apply requirement](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/apply-requirements.html#supported-requirements) blocks applies on plans that fail any of the defined conftest policies.

![Policy Check Apply Status Failure](./images/policy-check-apply-status-failure.png)

Any failures need to either be addressed in a successive commit, or approved by a blessed owner. This approval is independent of the approval apply requirement which can coexist in the policy checking workflow. After an approval, the apply can proceed.

Any plans following the approval will discard any policy approval and prompt again for it.

## Getting Started

This section will provide a guide on how to get set up with a simple policy that fails creation of `null_resource`'s and requires approval from a blessed user.

### Step 1: Enable the workflow

Enable the workflow using the following server configuration flag `--enable-policy-checks`

### Step 2: Define the policy configuration

Policy Configuration is defined in the [server-side repo configuration](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/server-side-repo-config.html#reference).

In this example we will define one policy set with one owner:

```
policies:
  owners:
    users:
      - nishkrishnan
  policy_sets:
    - name: null_resource_warning
      path: <CODE_DIRECTORY>/policies/null_resource_warning/
      source: local
```

`name` - A name of your policy set.
`path` - Path to a policies directory.
`source` - Tells atlantis where to fetch the policies from. Currently you can only host policies locally by using `local`.

### Step 3: Write the policy

Conftest policies are based on [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) and written in [rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#what-is-rego). Following our example, simply create a `rego` file in `null_resource_warning` folder with following code, the code below a simple policy that will fail for plans containing newly created `null_resource`s.

```
package main

resource_types = {"null_resource"}

# all resources
resources[resource_type] = all {
    some resource_type
    resource_types[resource_type]
    all := [name |
        name:= input.resource_changes[_]
        name.type == resource_type
    ]
}

# number of creations of resources of a given type
num_creates[resource_type] = num {
    some resource_type
    resource_types[resource_type]
    all := resources[resource_type]
    creates := [res |  res:= all[_]; res.change.actions[_] == "create"]
    num := count(creates)
}

deny[msg] {
    num_resources := num_creates["null_resource"]

    num_resources > 0

    msg := "null resources cannot be created"
}

```

::: tip Notes
By default conftest is configured to only run the `main` package. If you want to change this behavior [`extra_args`](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/custom-workflows.html#adding-extra-arguments-to-terraform-commands) can be used to pass in flags to conftest such as `--namespace` or `--all-namespaces`
:::

That's it! Now your Atlantis instance is configured to run policies on your Terraform plans ðŸŽ‰
