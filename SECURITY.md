# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. Please report a security vulnerability to the maintainers using [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/security/advisories/new).

## Maintained releases

Only the two latest minor releases are maintained. For example, if `0.29.7` is the latest, then `0.29.x` and `0.28.x` will receive security fixes.
